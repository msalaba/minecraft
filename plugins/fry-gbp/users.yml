#Define individual user overrides here
#Permissions given or negated here override all others
#You can also grant or remove group membership here;
#   this will override group membership assigned in the normal way,
#   however you can't override the meta-groups
#for example:
#notch:
#  permissions:
#    - become.herobrine
#    - -shave.beard
#  worlds:
#    notchWorld:
#      - somePlugin.deity
#  groups:
#    - mojang
#    - -scumbags

# Note that unlike in the group files, the usernames here are CASE SENSITIVE
