# If this is false then settings 'EnabledSpawnReasons' and 'MobAbilities'
# will have no effect, and the global configuration for mobs will be used
# 
# NOTE: This setting does nothing in the global config
# 
# #######################################################################
# EnabledSpawnReasons
# #######################################################################
# When a Mob spawns, it is spawned with a given 'SpawnReason'
#     This list defines which of those 'SpawnReasons' that MobManager
# 	will check for.
# If a mob spawns with a listed 'SpawnReason' MobManager will apply
#     abilities to the mob
# 	
# Hint: If you have other plugins which spawn mobs with special gear
#     you can remove CUSTOM from the list of enabled spawn reasons
# 	so MobManager does not interfere with this
# 
# Note: By default all spawn reasons are checked
# 
# Valid spawn reasons can be found here:
#     http://jd.bukkit.org/apidocs/org/bukkit/event/entity/CreatureSpawnEvent.SpawnReason.html
# 
# #######################################################################
# MobAbilities
# #######################################################################
# Contains settings you can use to edit mob attributes.
# 
# Mob settings in world files will override global settings
# 
# Mob names must be acquired from here:
#     http://jd.bukkit.org/apidocs/org/bukkit/entity/EntityType.html
#     And should be in all upper-case
# 
# There are currently two types of mob Attributes/Abilities:
# 1) Rate: These have a single fixed chance of doing something
# 
#     rates are written as a simple number between 1.0 and 0.0
# 
# 2) ChanceList: These are a list of chances with values associated
#     with each chance. The chance of a given value being selected is
#     (chance) / (Sum of all chances)
#     
#     Each ChanceList has keys which can be used to customize the abilities
#     These keys can have numbers, strings or lists as their values.
#     
#     NOTE: Every Ability requires the key 'Chance'
#     
#     ChanceLists are written as below
#     <OPTION>:
#     - CHANCE: <Chance>
#       <KEY>: <Options>
